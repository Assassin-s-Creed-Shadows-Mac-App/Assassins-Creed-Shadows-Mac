## 🧩 Overview  

Assassin’s Creed: Shadows for macOS brings the iconic stealth-action saga to feudal Japan — an era of shifting alliances, brutal battles, and silent retribution. You’ll step into a world where honor and deception collide, mastering both the silent blade and the open battlefield as you forge your legend under the rising sun.  

Set within an expansive and reactive open world, the game lets you experience Japan’s landscapes as never before — from mist-covered temples and bustling marketplaces to fortified castles hidden in the mountains. Each mission can be approached your way: disappear into the shadows, strike unseen, or charge forward with raw power and skill.  

Players can embody two distinct heroes — a disciplined samurai and a cunning shinobi — each offering unique combat styles, abilities, and story arcs. This dual perspective provides a deep, cinematic experience that evolves with every decision you make.  

Designed to take advantage of modern macOS technology, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows delivers breathtaking visuals and seamless performance on both Apple Silicon and Intel-based systems. The level of environmental detail, dynamic lighting, and fluid motion ensures every assassination feels real, tense, and rewarding.  

As you traverse a nation caught between war and peace, every action you take shapes the path ahead. Will you fight with honor in the open or manipulate fate from the shadows? The choice — and the legacy — is yours to carve.
